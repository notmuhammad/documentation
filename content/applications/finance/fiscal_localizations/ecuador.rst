Introduction
============

With the Ecuadorian localization, it is possible to generate electronic documents using XML, fiscal
folio, electronic signature, and direct connection to tax authority SRI.

The supported documents are invoices, credit notes, debit notes, purchase liquidations, and
withholds.

The localization also includes automations to easily predict the withholding tax to be applied to
each purchase invoice.

The :ref:`ATS Report module <ecuador/ats>` enables the following:

- Choosing the SRI Payment Method in each payment method's configuration.
- Customers can manually input their identification type and identification number during the
  eCommerce checkout process.
- Automatically generating a valid electronic invoice for Ecuador at the end of the checkout
  process.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Website
*******

To generate an invoice after the checkout process, navigate to
:menuselection:`Website app --> Configuration --> Settings` and activate the
:guilabel:`Automatic Invoice` option found under the :guilabel:`Invoicing` section.

.. tip::
   The invoice's email template can be modified from the :guilabel:`Invoice Email Template` field
   under the :guilabel:`Automatic Invoice` option.

.. important::
   The sales journal used for invoicing is the first in the sequence of priority in the
   :guilabel:`Journal` menu.

Payment providers
*****************

To activate the payment providers that should be used to capture eCommerce payments, navigate to
:menuselection:`Website app --> Configuration --> Payment Providers` section. Then, click on the
:guilabel:`View other providers` button under the :guilabel:`Activate Payments` heading. From here,
each payment provider can be configured by selecting a provider record. Refer to the
:doc:`payment provider <../payment_providers>` documentation for more information.

Payment methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To activate one or more payment methods for a payment provider, click
:guilabel:`→ Enable Payment Methods` within the :guilabel:`Configuration` tab of each provider.

When configuring the payment method, it is **mandatory** to set the :guilabel:`SRI Payment Method`
for each method. This field appears after creating and saving the payment method for the first
time.

.. note::
   Adding the :guilabel:`SRI Payment Method` is necessary to generate correctly the electronic
   invoice from an eCommerce sale. Select a **payment method** to access its configuration menu and
   the field.

eCommerce workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Identification type and number
******************************

The client who is making a purchase will have the option to indicate their identification type and
number during the checkout process. This information is required to correctly generate the
electronic invoice after the checkout is completed.

.. image:: ecuador/website-checkout-form.png
   :alt: Website checkout form.

.. note::
   Verification is done to ensure the :guilabel:`Identification Number` field is completed and has
   the correct number of digits. For RUC identification, 13 digits are required. For Cédula,
   9 digits are required.

After finishing the checkout process, a confirmed invoice is generated, ready to be sent manually or
asynchronously to the SRI.

Point of sale electronic invoicing
----------------------------------

Make sure the *Ecuadorian module for Point of Sale* (`l10n_ec_edi_pos`) is :ref:`installed
<l10n_ec/module-installation>` to enable the following features and configurations:

- Choose the SRI payment method in each payment method configuration.
- Manually input the customer's identification type and identification number when creating a
  new contact on *POS*.
- Automatically generate a valid electronic invoice for Ecuador at the end of the checkout process.

Payment method configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To :doc:`create a payment method for a point of sale <../../sales/point_of_sale/payment_methods>`,
go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Payment Methods`. Then, set the
:guilabel:`SRI Payment Method` in the payment method form.

Invoicing flows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Identification type and number
******************************

The POS cashier can :ref:`create a new contact for a customer <pos/customers>` who requests an
invoice from an open POS session.

The *Ecuadorian Module for Point of Sale* adds two new fields to the contact creation form:
:guilabel:`Identification Type` and :guilabel:`Tax ID`.

.. note::
   As the identification number length differs depending on the identification type, Odoo
   automatically checks the :guilabel:`Tax ID` field upon saving the contact form. To manually
   ensure the length is correct, know that the :guilabel:`RUC` and :guilabel:`Citizenship` types
   require 13 and 10 digits, respectively.

Electronic invoice: anonymous end consumer
******************************************

When clients do not request an electronic invoice for their purchase, Odoo automatically sets the
customer as :guilabel:`Consumidor Final` and generates an electronic invoice anyway.

.. note::
   If the client requests a credit note due to a return of this type of purchase, the credit note
   should be made using the client's real contact information. Credit notes cannot be created to
   *Consumidor Final* and can be managed :ref:`directly from the POS session <pos/refund>`.

Electronic invoice: specific customer
*************************************

If a customer requests an invoice for their purchase, it is possible to select or create a contact
with their fiscal information. This ensures the invoice is generated with accurate customer details.

.. note::
   If the client requests a credit note due to a return of this type of purchase, the credit note
   and return process can be managed :ref:`directly from the POS session <pos/refund>`.

Financial reports
=================

In Ecuador, there are fiscal reports that the company presents to SRI. Odoo supports two of the main
financial reports used by companies: **reports 103** and **104**.

To get these reports, go to
:menuselection:`Accounting app --> Reporting --> Statements Reports --> Tax Report` and then filter by
`Tax Report 103` or `Tax Report 104`.

Report 103
----------

This report contains information on income tax withholdings in a given period, and it can be
reported monthly or semi-annually. The report contains information about base, tax amounts, and tax
codes, and it can be use for SRI reporting.

Report 104
----------

This report contains information on VAT tax and VAT withholding for a given period, and it can be
generated monthly or semi-annually. The report contains information about base, tax amounts, and
tax codes, and it can be use for SRI reporting.

ATS report
----------

:ref:`Install <general/install>` the *ATS Report* (`l10n_ec_reports_ats`) module to enable
downloading the ATS report in XML format.

.. note::
   The Ecuadorian *ATS Report* module depends on the previous installation of the *Accounting* app
   and the *Ecuadorian EDI module*.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To issue electronic documents, ensure the company is configured as explained in the
:ref:`electronic invoice <l10n_ec/configure-your-company>` section.

In the :abbr:`ATS (Anexo Transaccional Simplificado)`, every document generated in Odoo (invoices,
vendor bills, sales and purchases withholdings, credit notes, and debit notes) will be included.

Vendor bills
************

When generating a vendor bill, it is necessary to register the authorization number from the
invoice that the vendor generated for the purchase. To do so, go to
:menuselection:`Accounting app --> Vendors --> Bills` and select the bill. Then, enter the number
from the vendor's invoice in the :guilabel:`Authorization Number` field.

Credit and debit notes
**********************

When generating a credit note or debit note manually or through an import, it is necessary to link
this note to the sales invoice that is being modified by it.

.. note::
   Remember to add all required information to the documents before downloading the :abbr:`ATS
   (Anexo Transaccional Simplificado)` file. For example, add the *Authorization Number* and the
   *SRI Payment Method* on documents, when needed.

XML generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To generate the :abbr:`ATS (Anexo Transaccional Simplificado)` report, go to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Reports --> Tax Report`. Choose a time period for the desired
:abbr:`ATS (Anexo Transaccional Simplificado)` report, then click :guilabel:`ATS`.

The downloaded XML file is ready to be uploaded to *DIMM Formularios*.

.. image:: ecuador/ats-report.png

.. note::
   When downloading the :abbr:`ATS (Anexo Transaccional Simplificado)` report, Odoo generates a
   warning pop-up alerting the user if a document(s) has missing or incorrect data. Nevertheless,
   the XML file can still be downloaded.
